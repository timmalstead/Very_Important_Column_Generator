#### The Literary Sage of our Age needs your help!!

Thomas Friedman lived a little too well last night and needs your help to finish his column before deadline. He already has a (brilliant) outline and needs you to supply several nouns, verbs, adjectives and proper phrases.

The Very Important Thomas Friedman Column Generator is a full stack web application with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) functionality, secure log in and password capabilities and a clean, responsive and intuitive interface. Created in the mold of the classic game madlibs, TVITFCG is sure to provide hours of knowing chuckles for the entire cultured family.
