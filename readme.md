#### The Literary Sage of our Age needs your help!!

Thomas Friedman lived a little too well last night and needs your help to finish his column before deadline. He already has a (brilliant) outline and needs you to supply several nouns, verbs, adjectives and proper phrases.

The Very Important Thomas Friedman Column Generator is a full stack web application with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) functionality, secure log in and password capabilities and a clean, responsive and intuitive interface. Created in the mold of the classic game madlibs, TVITFCG is sure to provide hours of knowing chuckles for the entire cultured family.

#### Site Usage

above: splash page

1)The user arrives at the splash page, which explains the premise of the site. Site navigation is controlled through the navbar at the top of the screen and though links below it that will appear or disappear depending on context.

2)At any time the user can toggle the color mode between light and dark. Also on the nav bar is the option to register and log in, and to create a new column when logged in.

3)When logged in, the user is taken to the article index page, which will display the articles a user has created. If the user does not currently have any articles created, it will display a prompt to create their first article. Also, the user can logout, edit his login info and change his password and view or delete created articles from this page.

4)Once clicking on the new article link or the new article prompt, the user is taken to a page with multiple text input fields. They are instructed what kind of word to enter into each. These placeholders include, nouns, verbs, proper names etc. If the user does not input into the country, unit of time, noun, adjective, verb or day of the week fields they will be randomly selected for a pre-existing list after clicking the create new article button. The user must input into the celebrity/world figure, abstract concept, blue collar occupation, inspirational quote and title fields for the column to display properly.

5)After clicking the create new article button, the user is taken to an article displaying a column populated with the words they entered. The user can then read it and then has the option to create another.
